# Production

A **printed circuit board (PCB)** is a carrier for electronic components. It serves for mechanical fastening and electrical connection. Almost every electronic device contains one or more printed circuit boards.
When a printed circuit board is assembled with electric parts, the term **PCBA** is used.

**Further information can be found in the following [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board).**

The two components of PCB and electric parts must be combined together to get a working board.
This combination process is shown in the following chapters where a MPPT solarcharger is taken as a production example; a PCB for running an electrical solar power system.
**The production of the PCB without the electrical parts is not part of this guide, it is obtained externally from the manufacturer**.

The production process of PCBs will be explained in the following chapters.
