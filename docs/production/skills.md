# Required Skills

For the successful performance of the following guide, some prior knowledge is necessary which is not described in detail.
In addition to general computer skills, basic knowledge in programming and electrical engineering is required.

**The following points give an overview of the prior knowledge needed.**

### ![ns_com](./images/needed_skills_computer.png) <br /> General Computer Skills

Dealing with a computer is almost a common knowledge in our time. **The computer skills is needed for:**

* Working with the file explorer.
* Installation of software programs which are downloaded from the Internet.
* Knowledge of standard interfaces (like USB-port, LAN).

### ![ns_c](./images/needed_skills_programming.png) <br /> Basic Knowledge in C/C++

The programming languages ​​C and C++ are the most commonly used languages. They are especially helpful in hardware-related context which means controlling physical systems by using these programming languages.
Profound programming skills are not required. However, the basic syntax of C and C++ should be understood for reading and adapting some code blocks:

* Adjustment of configuration parameters <br>(the software can be adapted to use different battery types).
* Flashing the Firmware on the embedded µC (Microcontroller).

### ![ns_eng](./images/needed_skills_electrical.png) <br /> Basic Knowledege in Electrical Enginnering

A basic understanding of electrical behavior is required. What is current, what is voltage and what does electrical resistance mean? These questions will not explicitly be answered. An introduction to this topic can be found in the following Wikipedia entry [Electrical Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_network).

**The electrical skills are needed for:**

* Understanding the behaviour of the total system.
* Measuring of the finished PCB to perform a functional test.

### ![ns_mech](./images/needed_skills_practical.png) <br /> Practical Work with electrical components

The handling of electrical components differs from other handcraft activities in the electric current that comes into play and this can be dangerous if it is handled incorrectly.
The electric boards which are reproduced with the provided guide have a low current flow as long as no solar panels are connected.

### Electrical Engineering Safety Rules

1. Switch off
2. Lock against reclosure
3. Check that lines and equipment are dead
4. Ground and short circuit phases
5. Cover, partition or screen of adjacent line sections

One of the most common mistakes when working with electrical components is causing a short circuit.
A short circuit means the direct contact of the plus and minus poles without any resistance in between. In the event of a short circuit the maximum current flows and without any fuse the used components will break. Therefore, the continuous check of not causing direct contact between the plus and minus poles especially with working with batteries is a must.

For the board production, **the following previous knowledge in practical work is needed:**

* Hand soldering of boards with a soldering iron and solder
* A steady hand for placing the SMD components on the board
* Good eyes for recognizing the characteristics of each component
